# Bransen Erickson's Portfolio
Welcome to my project portfolio. This repository serves as a curated directory of the various software development projects I’ve worked on, spanning academic, personal, and professional initiatives. Each linked repository includes source code, documentation, and, where applicable, instructions for building or running the project.

Some projects appear in multiple categories if they involve more than one programming language—for example, full-stack applications with both frontend and backend components.

Feel free to explore the links below to learn more about each project. Feedback, suggestions, and contributions are always welcome.
